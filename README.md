# LLM-Topic-Analysis-of-Clothing-Reviews-with-Embeddings
Analyzing clothing reviews on an e-commerce platform to explore different topics and similarities among them.


Project Structure:
Create and store the embeddings
Embed the reviews using a suitable text embedding algorithm 
Apply an appropriate dimensionality reduction technique to reduce the embeddings to a 2-dimensional numpy array 
Plot a 2D visual representation of the reviews.
Use the embeddings to identify some reviews that discuss topics such as 'quality', 'fit', 'style', 'comfort', etc.
Write a function that outputs the closest 3 reviews to a given input review, enabling a more personalized customer service response.
